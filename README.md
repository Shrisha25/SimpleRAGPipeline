# SimpleRAGPipeline
This repository implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using pre-trained models to extract answers from PDF documents based on user-provided questions.

# Project Overview:
The project is a simplified implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for answering questions from a PDF document. It extracts text from a PDF file, applies a pre-trained question-answering model to generate answers to user queries, and returns the answers. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate a basic RAG pipeline setup using common NLP libraries and tools.
